# fifa_preprocessing

This module provides methods conceived to preprocess data stored
in a csv file etc., with the intent to perform data analysis and
Machine Learning.

It was originally created to preprocess data from the EA Sports'
FIFA 19 for a Machine Learning project to predictplayers' wages
by regression. Therefore it contains functions that can be
universally used for data preprocessing but also functions that
are made specifically with the FIFA 19 data set in mind.
